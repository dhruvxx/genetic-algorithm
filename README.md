# Genetic Algorithm

The problem statement is given in [Project.pdf](https://github.com/codelixir/genetic-algorithm/blob/main/Project.pdf).

[src](https://github.com/codelixir/genetic-algorithm/tree/main/src) contains all the code and the approach and observations are stated in [report.pdf](https://github.com/codelixir/genetic-algorithm/blob/main/report.pdf).

Note: In the file [src/client.py](https://github.com/codelixir/genetic-algorithm/blob/main/src/client.py) you need to edit the variables `SECRET_KEY` and `API_ENDPOINT` before you can run the code.
